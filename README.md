# Lungmarkerstudy_diagnosticalgorithm

Code used in the paper 'Liquid biopsy-based decision support algorithms for diagnosis and subtyping of lung cancer' by Visser et al. 

The code can be used for 2 purposes:
- Training models with the same logistic regression pipeline using own input features
  - Recursive feature elimination
  - Training using the 'optimal' set of markers
- Applying the models from the articles to new patients for predicting of probabilities
